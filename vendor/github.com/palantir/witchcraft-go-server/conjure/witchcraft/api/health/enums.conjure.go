If any of the nodes in the service were to be restarted, it may result in correctness or consistency issues with the service. Ex: When a cassandra node decides it is not up-to-date and needs to repair, the node is operating in a degraded state. Restarting the node prior to the repair being complete might result in the service being unable to correctly respond to requests.

	HealthStateError HealthState = "ERROR"
	// The service node has entered an unrecoverable state. All nodes of the service should be stopped and no automated attempt to restart the node should be made. Ex: a service fails to migrate to a new schema and is left in an unrecoverable state.
